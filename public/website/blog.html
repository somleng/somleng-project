                In August 2023 my wife Mara and I traveled to

                in Southern Laos to help setup an Early Warning System pilot for

                The Early Warning System is targeting three provinces of Southern Laos:

              </p>

              <p>
                This blog post covers the journey to Laos and the setup of the Early Warning System through Somleng.

              <h3>
                Getting to Pakse
              </h3>

              <p>
                My wife and I live on a small farm just south of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh" target="_blank" class="link">Phnom Penh</a> in Cambodia.
                There are flights from Phnom Penh to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vientiane" target="_blank" class="link">Vientiane</a> (Capital of Laos), but Pakse is still around 670 km from Vientiane and the only way to get there is by bus.
                On the other hand Pakse is only around 600 km from Phnom Penh. There's a bus from Phnom Penh to Pakse but it takes between 13 and 15 hours which didn't sound fun.
                So we decided to put our stuff in a big black plastic bag, tie it to the back of my
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_XL250" target="_blank" class="link">1993 Honda Degree</a> and hit the road.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Day 1 - Phnom Penh to Stung Treng, Cambodia
              </h4>

              <p>
                We left home around 7:00am and headed north, crossing Kandal, Prey Veng, Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces and finally reaching
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stung_Treng_province" target="_blank" class="link">Stung Treng</a> around 3:00pm.

                Day 2 - Stung Treng, Cambodia to Don Det, Laos (Border Crossing)
              </h4>

              <p>
                The Cambodian-Laos border is around 70 km from Stung Treng city but the road is unpaved from the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekong_Bridge" target="_blank" class="link">Sekong bridge</a> just outside of Stung Treng city all the way to the border.
                At the border on the Cambodian side there is nothing much except for a few shops where you can change
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_riel" target="_blank" class="link">Cambodian Riel</a> (or presumably US Dollars) into
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_kip" target="_blank" class="link">Lao Kip</a>. We actually did this at a money changer in Stung Treng before we left.
                Note that you will need some Lao Kip before entering Laos. There are no ATMs or money changers on the Laos side of the border, and nobody in Laos will accept Cambodian Riel or any other currency for that matter.
              </p>

              <h5>
                Crossing the Border at Trapaingkriel Border Checkpoint
              </h5>

              <p>
                If your crossing with a motorbike you'll have to go though <em>both</em> immigration and customs on the Cambodian side.
                The immigration official asked us for 10,000 Riel ($2.50) per passport after stamping us out. I'm sure this is a non-official payment
                since I've never been asked to pay when leaving Cambodia in the past. However I've lived in South East Asia for 15 years, (Cambodia for 11 of those)
                and I understand that immigration officials don't get paid enough to raise their families on the official salary, so I don't really have a problem helping them out.
              </p>

              <p>
                After you stamp out of Cambodia, you'll have to go to the customs office, where the official will check the paperwork for your motorbike.
                The important document that you need is the ownership paper for the Motorbike. In Cambodia this is known as the vehicle identification card or (កាតគ្រី).
                Note that it doesn't matter if this document has the previous owner's name, but you must posses the actual card.
              </p>

              <img src="./images/motorbike-id-card-front.png" class="expanded__image">
              <img src="./images/motorbike-id-card-back.png" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                If you don't have the paperwork for the motorcycle, the customs official may still be able to process the export documents, but you may have to pay between $10 and $20.
                Again, I think this is reasonable, especially if you don't have the required documents. If you stand there and argue, they are within their rights not to let you cross with the motorbike.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fortunately for us, when we entered customs office, the customs official instantly recognized my wife and I.
                He went to high school with my wife and her brother and I had met him once before in Phnom Penh. Needless to say, he helped fill out the export documents for us,
                and we were soon on our way to the Laos side.
              </p>

              <img src="./images/vanny-dave-mara-camboda-laos-border.jpeg">

              <h5 id="entering-laos">
                Entering Laos
              </h5>

              <p>
                There's a tiny office on the Laos side of the border before you get to the main immigration section. Apparently this is so called <em>vehicle immigration</em> where the Laos official
                will stamp your export paper from the Cambodian side. We had to pay 10,000 Riel (or $2.50) for this stamp. However this is not the document that are required to enter Laos with your motorbike.
                This is basically just a stamp for the customs official in Laos to see that the export paper from Cambodia has been stamped on the Laos side.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once we got to immigration on the Laos side, the immigration official, told us that we could not enter Laos with our motorbike and if we still wanted to purchase a Laos visa.
                At this point we were confused because we assumed that the stamp from the so called "vehicle immigration" was enough. At this point the immigration officer asked us to go to speak to customs for further
                clarification.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Lao customs official could not (or refused) to speak English with us.
                However, a local Lao guide who was at the border with another tour group, helped translate for us.
                According to the Lao customs official there's a new rule that only organized motorbike tours are allowed to enter Laos with a motorbike.
                The tours must have a local Lao guide and official paperwork. The Lao customs official didn't even try to ask us for money to get around the problem, he just
                flat out refused to let us enter with the motorbike.
              </p>

              <p>
                We decided to contact Mara's high school friend (the customs official on the Cambodian side) to see if he could help us on the Laos side.
                He came over to the Laos side and was also surprised about this new rule. He had been issuing paperwork on the Cambodian side but never had
                this problem before. He spoke with the Lao customs official, but he still didn't allow us to enter. So we prepared to take our motorbike back
                to the Cambodian side, leave it at the border and take a bus to Pakse.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the meantime, our Cambodian customs official friend was speaking with boss of the Lao customs official, and finally he came to us and said
                they would make an exception this time. If it wasn't for our friend on the Cambodian side there was no chance of us getting the motorbike into Laos, even with the
                correct paperwork.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Lao customs official charged us 50,000 Riel ($12.50) for the motorbike papers to enter Laos (I'm pretty sure this is more than the official amount) but we were
                happy to pay anyway. A Laos Tourist Visa also costs $40.
              </p>

              <img src="./images/lao-motorbike-permission.png" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                There is literally nothing on the Laos side of the border. No shops. No ATMs. No money changers. Just a road (with not much traffic). That's why if you are traveling by motorbike
                it is important to have some Lao Kip before you cross in case you need to stop to buy water or petrol or something.

              <p>
                After entering Laos, we put asked Google maps to give us directions to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Det" target="_blank" class="link">Don Det</a>
                (part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si_Phan_Don" target="_blank" class="link">4,000 islands</a>) where we planned on staying the night.
                I don't really trust Google Maps in Cambodia and have been burnt a few times, so I double checked to see if the route seemed reasonable.
                I could see a bridge over the Mekong to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khong_Island" target="_blank" class="link">Don Khong</a>, a ferry to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Som" target="_blank" class="link">Don Som</a>, and finally another ferry to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Det" target="_blank" class="link">Don Det</a>.
                This sounded reasonable (and fun!) so we headed for our first stop Don Khong.
              </p>

                River crossing from Don Khong to Don Som
              </h5>

              <p>
                After crossing the bridge onto Don Khong, there's a short road to the ferry crossing. It costs 20,000 Lao Kip (approx $1) to cross over to Don Som.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Don Som Road is difficult but beautiful. Basically it's just a narrow path through the rice fields. Along the way I
                had some issues with my chain coming off, but we eventually found a small shop selling drinks and doubling as a mechanic who helped fix it.

              <p>
                Don Det and Don Khon are connected by a bridge. Both islands are way more touristy than Don Som and all the roads are paved. We visited the
                Liphi Somphamit Waterfalls and the Old French Port and enjoyed a few beers before finding a place to stay on Don Khon.

                We left Don Det on the ferry to Nakasong which takes around 20 minutes. That's when we realized that actually Google Maps told us to go wrong way on the previous day.

                Along the way we got burnt by Google Maps again while trying to find a waterfall in the Bolaven Plateau. After riding on a dirt track for a few kilometers
                I had issues with my chain again. We found a rubber plantation and one of the workers helped me fix the chain until we could find a proper mechanic.
                We decided to give up on the waterfall and head for Pakse.

                In order to have a better understanding about how we setup the Early Warning System in Laos, it's useful to understand how it works in Cambodia.
                Somleng is already

                In this system, Somleng is connected to each of the main Mobile Network Operators as shown Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.

              <p>
                As you can see both the registration flow and broadcast flow for the Laos system is almost identical as the Cambodian system.
                The main point of difference being that we're replacing the mobile network operators with an off-the-shelf VoIP Gateway.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are of course some limitations of this setup such as:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    The maximum throughput of the system is limited to the number of channels in the VoIP gateway.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Only full local Lao mobile numbers can be used as opposed to a single short code.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A local entity needs to ensure that the SIM cards are active. For example prepaid cards have enough balance, and postpaid cards have their bills paid.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>

              <p>
                On the other hand, the benefit of this system, is that it can be built entirely with open source software and off-the-shelf hardware.

              <p>
                We left Pakse with the intention of making it back to Stung Treng, however we saw a sign
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vat_Phou" target="_blank" class="link">Wat Phou</a> around 30 km south of Pakse, so we decided to turn off and take a look.
                We arrived at  a small village where the ferry terminal is, but we accidentally took the wrong road down to the river bank. There was a young lady with a small wooden boat
                who gestured that she would take us across the Mekong river to Champasak town. Mara wasn't sure about the safety of the boat as you'll see in the videos below. 😂

              <p>
                After making it safely across the river we rode south along the western side of the Mekong to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vat_Phou" class="link" target="_blank">Wat Phou (ວັດພູ)</a>.
                Entrance is only 100,000 Lao Kip (approx $5) per person and it's well worth it as the temple is magnificent.

              <p>
                After leaving Wat Phou, we decided to stay on the western side of the Mekong and continue heading south.
                The plan was to find a ferry back to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khong_Island" target="_blank" class="link">Don Khong</a>
                and then cross back over the same bridge that we took on
                <a href="#road-to-don-det" target="_blank" class="link">the road to Don Det</a>.
                The road was pretty rough but the scenery was beautiful.

              <p>
                We eventually found a ferry crossing before we reached Don Khong and crossed back over to the eastern side of the Mekong to the main highway and headed for the border, arriving around 5.00pm.

              <p>
                Shortly after crossing into Cambodia it started to piss down with rain.
                Fortunately we ran into Mara's high school friend (who helped us with the Motorbike paperwork at
                <a href="#entering-laos" target="_blank" class="link">the border on the way in</a>).
                He convinced us not to try to ride to Stung Treng in the rain and dark and suggested that we have a couple of beers with him.
                So we did and ended up staying the night at his friend's house just near the border.

              <p>

              <p>
                Individuals and organizations can also use this feature by connecting their SMS gateway to a device that supports SMPP, such as a

              <p>
                At Somleng, one of our biggest customer bases are NGOs. One of the reasons that NGOs choose us is because we work with local carriers
                directly. This allows us to provide cloud communication services in new markets where it's otherwise unavailable, or with better quality, and
                <a href="case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia" target="_blank" class="link">a fraction of the cost of our competitors <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Although working with local carriers improves quality and reduces costs, one of the biggest pain points for our customers
                is actually engaging with and arriving at a commercial agreement with a local carrier.
                Often our customers want to get something up and running quickly to prove a concept or do a pilot, without
                engaging with their local carrier.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Bypassing Carriers
              </h4>

              <p>
                It turns out that it's actually possible to access the local public switched telephone network (PSTN) without a commercial agreement with a local carrier.
                All you need is a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP_gateway" target="_blank" class="link">VoIP gateway <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and one or more SIM cards.
                A VoIP gateway has interfaces to both IP networks and the PSTN and handles the bridging between them. One interface can be connected to the Internet and the other
                to the PSTN, via SIM card(s) inserted into the VoIP gateway.
                VoIP gateways range in size 1 from to 128 channels or more. The more channels you have the more concurrent calls you can support.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today we're excited to announce official support for VoIP gateways on Somleng.
              </p>

              <p>
                With this new feature customers can
                <a href="https://app.somleng.org/users/sign_up" target="_blank" class="link">sign up <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                and connect their VoIP gateway to Somleng by

              </p>

              <p>
                After the connection is configured, customers can programmatically make outbound calls through your VoIP gateway using the
                <a href="docs/twilio_api" target="_blank" class="link">REST API <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,
                and programmatically control both outbound and inbound calls via TwiML.

              <h4>
                Network Providers
              </h4>

              <p>
                This new feature also opens up new business opportunities for individuals or organizations to provide access to the
                PSTN in their country via a VoIP gateway that they own or manage. We call this type of user a
                <a href="docs.html#network_provider" target="_blank" class="link">Network Provider <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,
                and like carriers, they can also create customer accounts on Somleng.
              </p>

              <p>
                Any account that the Network Provider creates, is managed by them and has its own set of
                <a href="docs/twilio_api" target="_blank" class="link">REST API <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                credentials and account management interface.
                A network provider can therefore onboard their own customers,
                by creating them an account and providing them with PSTN access through their VoIP gateway(s).
              </p>

              <p>
                This can be combined with our
                <a href="docs/#custom_domains" target="_blank" class="link">custom domains feature <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                feature resulting in a fully custom-branded experience for your customer.
              </p>

              <p>
                We don't yet have a way for a network provider to monetize this business flow directly on the Somleng platform, but it's something we will consider
                if enough users request this feature.

                Following on from our introductory blog post
                <a href="#the-somleng-story" class="link">The Somleng Story</a> in this post we'll do a deep dive into
                how local carriers can offer programmable voice to their customers via Somleng.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Why carriers should offer programmable voice to their customers?
              </h4>

              <p>
                Programmable voice has a variety of different use-cases such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Alerts and Notifications - e.g. password resets, low balance alerts, bill reminders, fraud warnings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Disaster Management, mHealth <a href="case_studies.html" target="_blank" class="link">and more <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                Twilio has become the de-facto go-to solution for programmable voice and
                <a href="https://investors.twilio.com/news/news-details/2022/Twilio-Announces-First-Quarter-2022-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20%24875.4%20million%20for,%25%20year%2Dover%2Dyear." target="_blank" class="link">profits exorbitantly <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                as a result. But actually local carriers can offer much
                <a href="case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia" target="_blank" class="link">cheaper pricing <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                and better quality since they are the custodians of the network.
              </p>
              <p>
                By offering programmable voice as a solution, local carriers can share in the profits and obtain an advantage
                over their competitors all while protecting their own branding.
              </p>

              <h4>
                What is Somleng?
              </h4>

              <p>
                Somleng is an Open Source, white-labeled, Cloud Communications as a Service (CPaaS) solution.
                Unlike Twilio, which is a global centralized CPaaS designed for platform users directly,
                Somleng is designed for carriers and network operators.
              </p>

              <p>
                Instead of platform users signing up directly on Somleng, Carriers instead sign up
                for a Somleng carrier account and manage their own customer accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the release of our new
                <a href="docs.html#custom_domains" target="_blank" class="link">custom domains <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                feature,
                a carrier can now configure their own custom domain and branding, providing a fully branded CPaaS solution their platform customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Carriers can then invite their customers to their branded dashboard via their custom domain where the customer can manage their own account and API credentials.
                The customer can then use Somleng's REST API for programmable voice.
              </p>

                For a while now, Twilio has become the king of cloud communications.
                Although there has been a few clones pop up over the years, e.g. Vonage, Message Bird, etc.
                the space has remained relatively same same. Until now...

                But to understand where we're going and why, it's important to understand where we've come from.

                Starting back in 2012 Somleng's predecessor was a SMS and Voice powered dating service called Chibi.
                Launching in Cambodia, before the Smartphones and Facebook were ever really a thing (in Cambodia at least)
                subscribers would dial into a short-code and be randomly connected to another subscriber.
                Basically a chat roulette that worked over an ordinary voice call.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subscribers could also send text messages
                to their new 'friend' by simply texting to the short code. Chibi would scan the messages,
                and build up a basic profile of the subscriber, trying to determine their age, gender and location.
              </p>

              <p>
                The service was surprisingly popular, at its peak having more than 120,000 subscribers. But by 2015,
                smartphones and Facebook had taken over in Cambodia and Chibi eventually died.

                The requirements were simple. In case of a natural disaster (such as a flood),
                a government official could record a voice message and deliver it via phone call to citizens in the affected areas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Programmable voice is a perfect solution to this problem. Voice messages are recorded in Khmer,
                so it doesn't require the beneficiary be literate, have a smart phone nor have access to the Internet. They just pick up the
                phone and listen to the information recorded by the government official.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our experience with building scalable communications platform to power Chibi
                meant that the timing was perfect for a pivot and Somleng was born.

              <p>
                There's a growing consensus that the Internet is too centralized controlled by too few players.
                It's no different in the cloud communications space. Big Tech controls most of the space
                and there are few options for individuals, small and medium sized companies, governments and NGOs.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somleng's vision is a world where communications are accessible to everyone.
                In order to achieve this vision we need to think outside the box and provide a solution benefits
                everyone, not just Big Tech.

              <p>
                The first step for Somleng, is to level the playing field for local carriers (for clarification a local carrier
                is a local telecom company, mobile network operator or aggregator).
              </p>
              <p>
                Twilio's et al. business model is based on a centralized Cloud Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS). They charge an
                expensive premium (especially in emerging markets), to basically act as a middle-man between the platform user and the beneficiary.
              </p>

              <p>
                But what if a local carrier, who controls the network connectivity in their region or country,
                could <em>be</em> their own Twilio? They could provide a similar service to Twilio at a
                <a href="case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia" target="_blank" class="link">fraction of the cost <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> by cutting them out of the flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the reduced costs for the platform user, the local carrier can protect their own branding and generate
                additional revenue streams.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somleng now supports
                <a href="docs.html#custom_domains" target="_blank" class="link">custom domains <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                allowing carriers to leverage Somleng's API and Dashboard, while keeping their own branding. Alternatively, since Somleng is 100% open source, local carriers can always host Somleng
                on their own servers.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Be your own carrier
              </h4>

              <img src="./images/undraw_programmer_re_owql.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                While supporting local carriers is a good first step, there's still a level of centralization at the local carrier level.
                In other words, Somleng now provides a solution to dissipate the monopoly of cloud communications from Big Tech
                to local carriers, but we can still go a step further to bring the power to individuals and organizations directly.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the features we'll be working on in the coming months is called "Be your own carrier".
                The idea is that any individual, business or organization can use Somleng to become a Network Provider, and provide the connectivity layer
                required for cloud communications, and in a future iteration, even be able to earn money from it.
              </p>

              <p>
                The idea is quite simple. Using readily available, off-the-shelf hardware such as a GSM Gateway or GSM Modem,
                a network provider can provide connectivity to their local mobile network and register their route with Somleng.
                Somleng will then route calls and SMS to/from the network provider to provide programmable voice and SMS to the platform user.
              </p>

              <p>
                A simple use-case for this is handling phone number verification via programmable voice.
                In order do achieve this now, you need to use a service like Twilio or Firebase.
                However with Somleng's "Be your own carrier" feature the application owner can register as a Network Provider,
                and their application can initiate a call via Somleng's REST API.
                The call is then routed via the network provider's hardware to the beneficiary's phone.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that any individual or organization can <em>be</em> their own carrier by becoming a network provider,
                the foundations are in place for a global marketplace of network providers and local carriers.
              </p>

              <h4>
                A more equitable CPaaS Economy
              </h4>

              <img src="./images/undraw_transfer_money_re_6o1h.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                The final step in Somleng's CPaaS revolution is to leverage the global network of local carriers and network providers
                to provide a more equitable CPaaS economy. Local operators and network providers can make their routes publicly available
                and set their own prices and be compensated for every interaction that goes through their route. In theory this should
                create competition for who can offer the cheapest, highest quality routes.
              </p>
