              <p>
                At Somleng, one of our biggest customer bases are NGOs. One of the reasons that NGOs choose us is because we work with local carriers
                directly. This allows us to provide cloud communication services in new markets where it's otherwise unavailable, or with better quality, and
                <a href="case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia" target="_blank" class="link">a fraction of the cost of our competitors <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Although working with local carriers improves quality and reduces costs, one of the biggest pain points for our customers
                is actually engaging with and arriving at a commercial agreement with a local carrier.
                Often our customers want to get something up and running quickly to prove a concept or do a pilot, without
                engaging with their local carrier.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Bypassing Carriers
              </h4>

              <p>
                It turns out that it's actually possible to access the local public switched telephone network (PSTN) without a commercial agreement with a local carrier.
                All you need is a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP_gateway" target="_blank" class="link">VoIP gateway <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and one or more SIM cards.
                A VoIP gateway has interfaces to both IP networks and the PSTN and handles the bridging between them. One interface can be connected to the Internet and the other
                to the PSTN, via SIM card(s) inserted into the VoIP gateway.
                VoIP gateways range in size 1 from to 128 channels or more. The more channels you have the more concurrent calls you can support.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today we're excited to announce official support for VoIP gateways on Somleng.
              </p>

              <p>
                With this new feature customers can
                <a href="https://app.somleng.org/users/sign_up" target="_blank" class="link">sign up <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>

              </p>

              <p>
                After the connection is configured, customers can programmatically make outbound calls through your VoIP gateway using the
                <a href="docs/twilio_api" target="_blank" class="link">REST API <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,
                and programmatically control both outbound and inbound calls via TwiML.
              </p>

              <p>

              <h4>
                Network Providers
              </h4>

              <p>
                This new feature also opens up new business opportunities for individuals or organizations to provide access to the
                PSTN in their country via a VoIP gateway that they own or manage. We call this type of user a
                <a href="docs.html#network_provider" target="_blank" class="link">Network Provider <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,
                and like carriers, they can also create customer accounts on Somleng.
              </p>

              <p>
                Any account that the Network Provider creates, is managed by them and has its own set of
                <a href="docs/twilio_api" target="_blank" class="link">REST API <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                credentials and account management interface.
                A network provider can therefore onboard their own customers,
                by creating them an account and providing them with PSTN access through their VoIP gateway(s).
              </p>

              <p>
                This can be combined with our
                <a href="docs/#custom_domains" target="_blank" class="link">custom domains feature <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                feature resulting in a fully custom-branded experience for your customer.
              </p>

              <p>
                We don't yet have a way for a network provider to monetize this business flow directly on the Somleng platform, but it's something we will consider
                if enough users request this feature.
              </p>

                Following on from our introductory blog post
                <a href="#the-somleng-story" class="link">The Somleng Story</a> in this post we'll do a deep dive into
                how local carriers can offer programmable voice to their customers via Somleng.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Why carriers should offer programmable voice to their customers?
              </h4>

              <p>
                Programmable voice has a variety of different use-cases such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Alerts and Notifications - e.g. password resets, low balance alerts, bill reminders, fraud warnings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Disaster Management, mHealth <a href="case_studies.html" target="_blank" class="link">and more <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                Twilio has become the de-facto go-to solution for programmable voice and
                <a href="https://investors.twilio.com/news/news-details/2022/Twilio-Announces-First-Quarter-2022-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20%24875.4%20million%20for,%25%20year%2Dover%2Dyear." target="_blank" class="link">profits exorbitantly <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                as a result. But actually local carriers can offer much
                <a href="case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia" target="_blank" class="link">cheaper pricing <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                and better quality since they are the custodians of the network.
              </p>
              <p>
                By offering programmable voice as a solution, local carriers can share in the profits and obtain an advantage
                over their competitors all while protecting their own branding.
              </p>

              <h4>
                What is Somleng?
              </h4>

              <p>
                Somleng is an Open Source, white-labeled, Cloud Communications as a Service (CPaaS) solution.
                Unlike Twilio, which is a global centralized CPaaS designed for platform users directly,
                Somleng is designed for carriers and network operators.
              </p>

              <p>
                Instead of platform users signing up directly on Somleng, Carriers instead sign up
                for a Somleng carrier account and manage their own customer accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the release of our new
                <a href="docs.html#custom_domains" target="_blank" class="link">custom domains <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                feature,
                a carrier can now configure their own custom domain and branding, providing a fully branded CPaaS solution their platform customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Carriers can then invite their customers to their branded dashboard via their custom domain where the customer can manage their own account and API credentials.
                The customer can then use Somleng's REST API for programmable voice.
              </p>

                For a while now, Twilio has become the king of cloud communications.
                Although there has been a few clones pop up over the years, e.g. Vonage, Message Bird, etc.
                the space has remained relatively same same. Until now...

              <p>
                Somleng has the ambitious goal of revolutionizing the cloud communications space turning it on its head.
                We aim to take the power of cloud communications away from Big Tech's monopoly and bring it to the people.
                But to understand where we're going and why, it's important to understand where we've come from.

              <p>
                Starting back in 2012 Somleng's predecessor was a SMS and Voice powered dating service called Chibi.
                Launching in Cambodia, before the Smartphones and Facebook were ever really a thing (in Cambodia at least)
                subscribers would dial into a short-code and be randomly connected to another subscriber.
                Basically a chat roulette that worked over an ordinary voice call.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subscribers could also send text messages
                to their new 'friend' by simply texting to the short code. Chibi would scan the messages,
                and build up a basic profile of the subscriber, trying to determine their age, gender and location.
              </p>

              <p>
                The service was surprisingly popular, at its peak having more than 120,000 subscribers. But by 2015,
                smartphones and Facebook had taken over in Cambodia and Chibi eventually died.

                were looking for a solution for the
                <a href="case_studies.html#early-warning-system-cambodia" target="_blank" class="link">National Early Warning System <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                The requirements were simple. In case of a natural disaster (such as a flood),
                a government official could record a voice message and deliver it via phone call to citizens in the affected areas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Programmable voice is a perfect solution to this problem. Voice messages are recorded in Khmer,
                so it doesn't require the beneficiary be literate, have a smart phone nor have access to the Internet. They just pick up the
                phone and listen to the information recorded by the government official.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our experience with building scalable communications platform to power Chibi
                meant that the timing was perfect for a pivot and Somleng was born.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today Somleng is still powering Cambodia's Early Warning System.

              <p>
                There's a growing consensus that the Internet is too centralized controlled by too few players.
                It's no different in the cloud communications space. Big Tech controls most of the space
                and there are few options for individuals, small and medium sized companies, governments and NGOs.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somleng's vision is a world where communications are accessible to everyone.
                In order to achieve this vision we need to think outside the box and provide a solution benefits
                everyone, not just Big Tech.
              </p>

                Be your own Twilio
              </h4>

              <p>
                The first step for Somleng, is to level the playing field for local carriers (for clarification a local carrier
                is a local telecom company, mobile network operator or aggregator).
              </p>
              <p>
                Twilio's et al. business model is based on a centralized Cloud Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS). They charge an
                expensive premium (especially in emerging markets), to basically act as a middle-man between the platform user and the beneficiary.
              </p>

              <p>
                But what if a local carrier, who controls the network connectivity in their region or country,
                could <em>be</em> their own Twilio? They could provide a similar service to Twilio at a
                <a href="case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia" target="_blank" class="link">fraction of the cost <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> by cutting them out of the flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the reduced costs for the platform user, the local carrier can protect their own branding and generate
                additional revenue streams.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somleng now supports
                <a href="docs.html#custom_domains" target="_blank" class="link">custom domains <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                allowing carriers to leverage Somleng's API and Dashboard, while keeping their own branding. Alternatively, since Somleng is 100% open source, local carriers can always host Somleng
                on their own servers.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Be your own carrier
              </h4>

              <img src="./images/undraw_programmer_re_owql.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                While supporting local carriers is a good first step, there's still a level of centralization at the local carrier level.
                In other words, Somleng now provides a solution to dissipate the monopoly of cloud communications from Big Tech
                to local carriers, but we can still go a step further to bring the power to individuals and organizations directly.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the features we'll be working on in the coming months is called "Be your own carrier".
                The idea is that any individual, business or organization can use Somleng to become a Network Provider, and provide the connectivity layer
                required for cloud communications, and in a future iteration, even be able to earn money from it.
              </p>

              <p>
                The idea is quite simple. Using readily available, off-the-shelf hardware such as a GSM Gateway or GSM Modem,
                a network provider can provide connectivity to their local mobile network and register their route with Somleng.
                Somleng will then route calls and SMS to/from the network provider to provide programmable voice and SMS to the platform user.
              </p>

              <p>
                A simple use-case for this is handling phone number verification via programmable voice.
                In order do achieve this now, you need to use a service like Twilio or Firebase.
                However with Somleng's "Be your own carrier" feature the application owner can register as a Network Provider,
                and their application can initiate a call via Somleng's REST API.
                The call is then routed via the network provider's hardware to the beneficiary's phone.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that any individual or organization can <em>be</em> their own carrier by becoming a network provider,
                the foundations are in place for a global marketplace of network providers and local carriers.
              </p>

              <h4>
                A more equitable CPaaS Economy
              </h4>

              <img src="./images/undraw_transfer_money_re_6o1h.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                The final step in Somleng's CPaaS revolution is to leverage the global network of local carriers and network providers
                to provide a more equitable CPaaS economy. Local operators and network providers can make their routes publicly available
                and set their own prices and be compensated for every interaction that goes through their route. In theory this should
                create competition for who can offer the cheapest, highest quality routes.
              </p>
