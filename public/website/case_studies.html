              <p>
                Cambodia is a country consistently ranked as one of the most vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to deliver timely and potentially lifesaving information to people in disaster prone areas,
                an Early Warning System (EWS) was conceived by the organization,
                <a href="https://www.clovekvtisni.cz/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-aid-and-development/cambodia" target="_blank" class="link">People In Need (PIN) <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                People in Need realized that the EWS needs to be accessible to all Cambodians, regardless of literacy and Internet connectivity issues.
                They decided to look into a solution which uses voice based messaging for alerts
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response" target="_blank" class="link">Interactive Voice Response (IVR) <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> for registration.
              </p>

              <p>
                With help from the Royal Cambodian Government, the Telecommunication Regulator of Cambodia (TRC) and the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM),
                it was regulated that the Early Warning System must be provided free of charge by the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in Cambodia.
              </p>

              <p>
                With the pieces of the puzzle coming together the problems that still remained were:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    How to connect to the MNOs for user registration?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How to send out automated alerts to people at risk in the event of an emergency?
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>

              <p>
                The major mobile network operators in Cambodia each provided a SIP connection, but lacked the technology that
                People In Need required to handle user registrations and send out automated flood alerts.
              </p>

              <img src="./images/ews_poster.jpg">

              <p>
                <a href="open_source.html#somleng-scfm" target="_blank" class="link">Somleng SCFM <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                is an open source contact center platform and call flow manager designed for Somleng and Twilio.
                Somleng SCFM comes complete with its own REST API for managing contacts, callouts and phone calls
                and can be configured to send out alerts and listen for inbound calls through <a href="open_source.html#somleng" target="_blank" class="link">Somleng <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                which provides an open source implementation of Twilio's REST API.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unlike Twilio, Somleng gives you full control over where and how inbound and outbound calls are routed from/to.
                Somleng is configured to send out alerts and listen for inbound calls via SIP connections provided by the local mobile network operators.
              </p>

              <p>
                To summarize the technology:

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Citizens register for the Early Warning System by calling a short code and answering the prompts to select their address.
                    The call is first received by a local mobile network operator then forwarded to Somleng which handles the IVR.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Flood sensors which detect water level heights, trigger alerts and callouts via Somleng SCFM.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Somleng SCFM sends voice alerts through Somleng to the local mobile network operators.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                In Somalia returnee households from Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya and vulnerable households in Bay and Bakool
                received emergency unconditional cash-based transfer assistance package to help them meet their needs during the current drought period.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to share information and get feedback about the program,
                a voice-based messaging solution was proposed.
                In the proposal voice messages and surveys would be recorded in the Somali language
                and delivered to the household head by mobile phone calls.
              </p>

              <p>
                The price for terminating a call through Twilio in Somalia is <a href="https://www.twilio.com/voice/pricing/so" target="_blank" class="link">$0.7680 per minute <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
                To date more than 75.8 K minutes worth of calls have been sent out which would equate to $58,238.98 on Twilio.

                In comparison, Hormuud's pricing is between $0.04 and $0.07 per minute.

              <p>
                Somleng SCFM was again used in this project to provide Africa's Voices Foundation with a dashboard for scheduling callouts and managing recipients.
                Automated voice messages were sent to beneficiaries via Somleng through Hormuud.

                <p>
                  In Guatemala, 5 out of 10 children under six years old suffer from chronic child malnutrition.
                  Early childhood, is the greatest window of opportunity to support the development of children's brains, bodies, and abilities through comprehensive interventions.
                  Additionally, Guatemala is a multicultural and multilingual country, with 22 languages, including the Mayan, Spanish, Xinka and Garifuna.
                  The use of the Spanish language has predominated in healthcare services, making it difficult for Mayan speaking population throughout the country to access public services every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the objective of improving the nutritional conditions of children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women,
                  UNICEF Guatemala is coordinating with Government institutions at national, departmental and municipal level
                  the implementation of comprehensive strategy to address stunting in Huehuetenango, QuichÃ©, Chiquimula and Alta Verapaz.

                  Introduction
                </h4>

                <p>
                  People in Need (PIN)'s mHealth project, implemented in cooperation with
                  the Ministry of Health (MoH) Zambia Telecommunications Company Limited (ZAMTEL) and powered by Somleng,
                  is an innovative and one-of-a-kind intervention in Zambia.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The project uses voice recorded messages to overcome illiteracy barriers
                  and to improve maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes,
                  influence attitudes and enhance knowledge and skills of women about the importance of key health and nutrition behaviors.
                  The messages were incorporated into dialogues performed by a local drama group that created culturally appropriate characters
                  to provide an educative, engaging and entertaining service, effective at changing people's behaviors.
                  These dialogues were designed typically around specific topics such as health, nutrition or hygiene. The set contains key messages related to
                  maternal health and nutrition as well as nutrition and health of children aged 0-6 and 7-24 months.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The messages were designed to cover the most important behaviors in order to
                  provide timely information that supports the mother to provide the best possible
                  start to their child's life during the first 1000 days most critical days (from the
                  inception until the child is 2 years old). The pilot project targeted 100 women
                  in Mongu and Nalolo districts in Western Zambia and aimed to prove that the concept is
                  relevant and effective in the Zambian context.

                <ol>
                  <li>The messages are designed, consulted and approved by PIN and MoH.</li>
                  <li>The messages are translated to the local language, performed and recorded by a drama group at a radio station or recording studio.</li>
                  <li>PIN engages health staff from the health facilities the self-registration of women.</li>
                  <li>The beneficiaries receive the voice messages as phone calls.</li>
                  <li>PIN performs a study and collects endline data to measure impact of the intervention.</li>

                  Results

                <ul>
                  <li>At endline, 89% of target women were aware that the recommended birth spacing is 2-3 years compared to 81% at baseline.</li>
                  <li>Furthermore, after they received the voice-recorded messages, 99% of women were aware of exclusive breastfeeding and its significance compared to 81% before the intervention.</li>
                  <li>After they received the mHealth service, 72% of women were aware of the recommended length of breastfeeding (12-23 months) compared to only 62% at baseline.</li>
                  <li>At endline, 88% of women were practicing vitamin A supplementation compared to 80% before the start of the intervention.</li>
                  <li>Moreover, 74% of women were taking pregnancy supplements every day at endline compared to only 60% at baseline.</li>
                </ul>

                  Conclusion
                </h4>

                <p>
                  The study found that the mHealth intervention has had a significant impact on knowledge, attitudes and practices
                  of women with regards to maternal and infant nutrition and health.
                  The level of satisfaction suggests that the service fills an important gap, is effective at changing behaviors and
                  is highly relevant in the Zambian context. The results suggest that the intervention contributed to improved maternal\
                  and child health outcomes and led to changes in key nutrition behaviors.
                  With several upgrades and improvements, which are currently underway, the project indicators may improve further.

                  Background
                </h4>

                <p>
                  In January 2023, UNICEF Nepal launched a blockchain pilot to support 1,500 vulnerable households with cash distribution in the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhesh_Province" target="_blank" class="link">Madhesh province, Nepal <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
                  The cash distribution supports landless families, daily wagers and families with disabilities, with children under the age of five.
                  The pilot uses an open-source blockchain based solution called, Rehat - developed by
                  <a href="https://rumsan.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Rumsan <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, a UNICEF Venture Fund company, from Nepal.
