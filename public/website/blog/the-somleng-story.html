                For a while now, Twilio has become the king of cloud communications.
                Although there has been a few clones pop up over the years, e.g. Vonage, Message Bird, etc.
                the space has remained relatively same same. Until now...
              </p>
              <p>
                Somleng has the ambitious goal of revolutionizing the cloud communications space turning it on its head.
                We aim to take the power of cloud communications away from Big Tech's monopoly and bring it to the
                people.
                But to understand where we're going and why, it's important to understand where we've come from.
              </p>

              <h4>
                ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­ Cambodian Dating
              </h4>

              <img src="../images/undraw_everywhere_together_re_xe5a.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                Starting back in 2012 Somleng's predecessor was a SMS and Voice powered dating service called Chibi.
                Launching in Cambodia, before the Smartphones and Facebook were ever really a thing (in Cambodia at
                least)
                subscribers would dial into a short-code and be randomly connected to another subscriber.
                Basically a chat roulette that worked over an ordinary voice call.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subscribers could also send text messages
                to their new 'friend' by simply texting to the short code. Chibi would scan the messages,
                and build up a basic profile of the subscriber, trying to determine their age, gender and location.
              </p>

              <p>
                The service was surprisingly popular, at its peak having more than 120,000 subscribers. But by 2015,
                smartphones and Facebook had taken over in Cambodia and Chibi eventually died.
              </p>

              <h4>
                ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­ National Early Warning System
              </h4>

              <img src="../images/undraw_weather_notification_4sbo.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                Around 2016, the Royal Cambodian Government in partnership with the NGO People In Need,
                were looking for a solution for the
                <a href="../case_studies.html#early-warning-system-cambodia" target="_blank" class="link">National Early
                  Warning System <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                The requirements were simple. In case of a natural disaster (such as a flood),
                a government official could record a voice message and deliver it via phone call to citizens in the
                affected areas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Programmable voice is a perfect solution to this problem. Voice messages are recorded in Khmer,
                so it doesn't require the beneficiary be literate, have a smart phone nor have access to the Internet.
                They just pick up the
                phone and listen to the information recorded by the government official.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our experience with building scalable communications platform to power Chibi
                meant that the timing was perfect for a pivot and Somleng was born.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today Somleng is still powering Cambodia's Early Warning System.

              <img src="../images/undraw_scrum_board_re_wk7v.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                There's a growing consensus that the Internet is too centralized controlled by too few players.
                It's no different in the cloud communications space. Big Tech controls most of the space
                and there are few options for individuals, small and medium sized companies, governments and NGOs.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somleng's vision is a world where communications are accessible to everyone.
                In order to achieve this vision we need to think outside the box and provide a solution benefits
                everyone, not just Big Tech.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Be your own Twilio
              </h4>

              <img src="../images/undraw_building_re_xfcm.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                The first step for Somleng, is to level the playing field for local carriers (for clarification a local
                carrier
                is a local telecom company, mobile network operator or aggregator).
              </p>
              <p>
                Twilio's et al. business model is based on a centralized Cloud Communications Platform as a Service
                (CPaaS). They charge an
                expensive premium (especially in emerging markets), to basically act as a middle-man between the
                platform user and the beneficiary.
              </p>

              <p>
                But what if a local carrier, who controls the network connectivity in their region or country,
                could <em>be</em> their own Twilio? They could provide a similar service to Twilio at a
                <a href="../case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia" target="_blank" class="link">fraction
                  of
                  the cost <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> by cutting them out of the flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the reduced costs for the platform user, the local carrier can protect their own branding
                and generate
                additional revenue streams.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somleng now supports
                <a href="../docs.html#custom_domains" target="_blank" class="link">custom domains <i
                    class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
                allowing carriers to leverage Somleng's API and Dashboard, while keeping their own branding.
                Alternatively, since Somleng is 100% open source, local carriers can always host Somleng
                on their own servers.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Be your own carrier
              </h4>

              <img src="../images/undraw_programmer_re_owql.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                While supporting local carriers is a good first step, there's still a level of centralization at the
                local carrier level.
                In other words, Somleng now provides a solution to dissipate the monopoly of cloud communications from
                Big Tech
                to local carriers, but we can still go a step further to bring the power to individuals and
                organizations directly.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the features we'll be working on in the coming months is called "Be your own carrier".
                The idea is that any individual, business or organization can use Somleng to become a Network Provider,
                and provide the connectivity layer
                required for cloud communications, and in a future iteration, even be able to earn money from it.
              </p>

              <p>
                The idea is quite simple. Using readily available, off-the-shelf hardware such as a GSM Gateway or GSM
                Modem,
                a network provider can provide connectivity to their local mobile network and register their route with
                Somleng.
                Somleng will then route calls and SMS to/from the network provider to provide programmable voice and SMS
                to the platform user.
              </p>

              <p>
                A simple use-case for this is handling phone number verification via programmable voice.
                In order do achieve this now, you need to use a service like Twilio or Firebase.
                However with Somleng's "Be your own carrier" feature the application owner can register as a Network
                Provider,
                and their application can initiate a call via Somleng's REST API.
                The call is then routed via the network provider's hardware to the beneficiary's phone.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that any individual or organization can <em>be</em> their own carrier by becoming a network
                provider,
                the foundations are in place for a global marketplace of network providers and local carriers.
              </p>

              <h4>
                A more equitable CPaaS Economy
              </h4>

              <img src="../images/undraw_transfer_money_re_6o1h.svg" class="expanded__image">

              <p>
                The final step in Somleng's CPaaS revolution is to leverage the global network of local carriers and
                network providers
                to provide a more equitable CPaaS economy. Local operators and network providers can make their routes
                publicly available
                and set their own prices and be compensated for every interaction that goes through their route. In
                theory this should
                create competition for who can offer the cheapest, highest quality routes.
              </p>

                Wrapping up
              </h4>
