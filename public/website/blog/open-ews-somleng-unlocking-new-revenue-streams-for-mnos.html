              <p>
                Around the world, governments and regulators are increasingly mandating that
                <strong>Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)</strong> play a central role in
                <strong>National Early Warning Systems (EWS)</strong>. Until now, the technology
                powering these systems has been dominated by expensive, closed solutions.
              </p>

              <p>
                <a href="https://www.open-ews.org/" class="link" target="_blank">OpenEWS</a> changes this.
                It's the world's first open source <a href="https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/r/openews"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">Digital
                  Public Good (DPG)</a>
                designed specifically for alerting authorities. Built to integrate seamlessly
                with <a href="https://www.somleng.org/" class="link" target="_blank">Somleng</a>, an open-source
                <strong>white-label CPaaS</strong>, OpenEWS provides governments with a
                cost-effective dissemination platform while creating new opportunities
                for MNOs to generate revenue.
              </p>

              <h2>How it Works</h2>
              <p>
                Alerting authorities use OpenEWS to create and send critical alerts. These alerts
                are distributed through Somleng, which connects directly to the MNO's network.
                For the MNO, this achieves two things:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>CSI Compliance:</strong> Support the nation's official EWS with minimal investment.</li>
                <li><strong>New Revenue Streams:</strong> Leverage the same CPaaS infrastructure to offer
                  <strong>AI-powered voice agents</strong>, <strong>programmable SMS</strong>, and
                  <strong>programmable voice services</strong> to enterprise customers.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Proven Business Model</h2>
              <p>
                Somleng already powers diverse revenue streams with income from both
                <strong>MNOs</strong> and <strong>NGOs</strong>. Our existing MNO customers
                exclusively use Somleng commercially to sell programmable communications
                and AI-powered agents in untapped markets.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, with OpenEWS integrated, MNOs can serve both the public sector
                (via national EWS) and the private sector (via CPaaS offerings)
                on a single platform.
              </p>

              <h2>Spotlight: Lao Telecom ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¦</h2>
              <p>
                Lao Telecom is set to become one of the first operators to use Somleng
                for both national impact and commercial growth. They will power the country's
                National Early Warning System through OpenEWS, while simultaneously launching
                new programmable communications and AI voice services for their enterprise
                customers.
              </p>

                style="max-width:100%; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:8px; margin:20px 0;">

              <p>
                This dual use case demonstrates the unique advantage of Somleng + OpenEWS:
                serving as <em>both</em> a public good and a commercial growth engine.
              </p>

              <h2>What's Next</h2>
              <p>
                We are expanding the platform to support:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>LBSMS</strong> (Location-Based SMS)</li>
                <li><strong>LBIVR</strong> (Location-Based IVR)</li>
                <li><strong>Cell Broadcast</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These capabilities will further strengthen MNOs' role in national EWS
                while opening up additional enterprise services.
              </p>

              <h2>Backed by GSMA Innovation Fund</h2>
              <p>
                OpenEWS and Somleng are proudly supported by the
                <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-for-development/digital-grantees-portfolio/somleng/"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">GSMA Innovation Fund</a>.
                With GSMA's backing, we are able to scale faster, collaborate more effectively
                with MNOs, and accelerate innovation at the intersection of public safety
                and commercial opportunity. This recognition underscores the global importance
                of building open, sustainable, and revenue-generating telecom solutions.
              </p>

              <h2>Join Us</h2>
              <p>
                With deployments already underway in Cambodia, Laos, and new projects
                beginning in Nepal, we are demonstrating a scalable model for
                MNOs worldwide.
              </p>

              <p>
                By partnering with OpenEWS and Somleng, MNOs can satisfy regulatory
                obligations, contribute to national resilience, and tap into the
                rapidly growing market for <strong>AI-powered voice and programmable
                  communications</strong>.
