## Scope
This Policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and other stakeholders of Chatterbox Solutions.

## Policy Statement
Chatterbox Solutions is committed to conducting its business activities with integrity, honesty, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We encourage individuals to report any concerns related to unethical, illegal, or improper conduct that may have a detrimental impact on the organization, its employees, stakeholders, or the community at large.

## Reporting Mechanism

### Internal Reporting
Reports of unethical, illegal, or improper conduct can be made through the following confidential channels:
- **Direct Supervisor or Manager**: Employees are encouraged to report concerns to their direct supervisor or manager.
- **Human Resources Department**: Concerns can be reported to the Human Resources Department either in person or through email.
- **CEO**: Concerns can be reported to the CEO either in person or through email to: dwilkie@somleng.org

### External Reporting

If individuals are uncomfortable reporting concerns internally or believe that internal reporting mechanisms have not adequately addressed the issue, or they do not belong to the organization, they have the right to report the matter externally. Whistleblowers can report concerns through anonymous email at whistleblowers@somleng.org. Upon reporting a concern, a whistleblower can expect a response acknowledging the receipt of the concern.

## Protection Against Retaliation
Chatterbox Solutions prohibits retaliation against individuals who, in good faith, report concerns or cooperate with investigations related to unethical, illegal, or improper conduct. Any form of retaliation against whistleblowers will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

## Investigation and Resolution
All reports of unethical, illegal, or improper conduct will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Investigations will be conducted in a fair, impartial, and confidential manner. Upon completion of the investigation, appropriate corrective action will be taken, which may include disciplinary action, implementation of preventive measures, and remediation of any harm caused.

## Confidentiality
Chatterbox Solutions is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of whistleblowers to the fullest extent possible, consistent with legal and regulatory requirements and the need to conduct an effective investigation.

## Compliance
All employees, contractors, vendors, and other stakeholders are expected to comply with this Policy. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract.

## Review and Revision
This Policy will be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
