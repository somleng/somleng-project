# Child Protection and Vulnerable Adult Safeguarding Policy

## Introduction

Chatterbox Solutions is committed to ensuring the safety, welfare, and protection of children and vulnerable adults who may come into contact with our organization. This Child Protection and Vulnerable Adult Safeguarding Policy ("Policy") outlines our commitment to preventing harm and addressing concerns related to the welfare of children and vulnerable adults.

## Policy Statement

Chatterbox Solutions recognizes its responsibility to safeguard children and vulnerable adults from abuse, neglect, exploitation, and harm. We are committed to:

- Providing a safe and supportive environment that promotes the well-being and protection of children and vulnerable adults.
- Adopting procedures and practices to prevent, identify, and respond to instances of abuse, neglect, or harm promptly and effectively.
- Raising awareness and providing training to employees, contractors, and volunteers to recognize signs of abuse, understand their responsibilities, and respond appropriately.
- Working in partnership with relevant authorities, agencies, and organizations to report concerns, investigate allegations, and support victims of abuse or harm.
- Respecting the rights, dignity, and confidentiality of children, vulnerable adults, and their families while ensuring their safety and well-being.

## Definitions

- **Child**: A person under the age of 18 years.
- **Vulnerable Adult**: Any person aged 18 or over who is or may be in need of community care services by reason of mental or other disability, age, illness, or other factors, and who is or may be unable to take care of themselves or protect themselves against significant harm or exploitation.
- **Abuse**: Any form of physical, emotional, sexual, or financial harm or mistreatment inflicted on a child or vulnerable adult, including neglect, exploitation, or discrimination.

## Responsibilities

### Management

- Provide leadership, resources, and oversight for effective policy implementation.
- Appoint a designated safeguarding lead to coordinate all safeguarding efforts and ensure compliance with relevant legal and ethical standards.

### Employees, Contractors, and Volunteers

- Must read, understand, and comply with this Policy.
- Required to attend safeguarding training and report any concerns promptly.

### Designated Safeguarding Lead

- Coordinates safeguarding activities and acts as the first point of contact for concerns.
- Assesses risk levels, takes appropriate action, and liaises with external authorities where needed.

## Reporting Procedures

- Any concerns or suspicions of abuse or harm must be reported **immediately** to the Designated Safeguarding Lead or another senior staff member.
- If the concern involves someone in a leadership position or if the reporter is uncomfortable using internal channels, they can email **[whistleblowers@somleng.org](mailto:whistleblowers@somleng.org)** to report the issue confidentially.

### Reporting Guidelines

- Include as much detail as possible, including the names of those involved, dates, times, observed behaviors, and any actions already taken.
- Anonymous reports will be accepted and investigated, though providing contact information may help with follow-up and clarification.
- All reports will be acknowledged within **72 hours** of receipt.

## Investigation Procedures

Once a report is received, Chatterbox Solutions will take the following steps:

1. **Initial Review**
   The Designated Safeguarding Lead will assess the nature and seriousness of the concern within **24 hours**. If the concern involves criminal conduct or immediate danger, the appropriate authority (e.g., child protection services, law enforcement) will be contacted without delay.

2. **Internal Investigation**
   An internal investigation will be conducted, led by the Designated Safeguarding Lead or an independent investigator, depending on the nature of the concern. All investigations will follow due process, ensure fairness, and avoid conflicts of interest.

3. **Confidentiality and Protection**
   Information will be shared only on a **need-to-know basis**. Retaliation against whistleblowers or reporters is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action.

4. **Outcome and Action**
   After investigation, appropriate action will be taken, which may include disciplinary measures, legal reporting, or support for affected individuals. Findings and actions will be documented and retained securely, in line with data protection regulations.

5. **Feedback and Follow-Up**
   The reporter will be informed (where appropriate and not breaching confidentiality) of the outcome of the investigation. Support and follow-up measures will be provided for any affected individuals.

## Response and Intervention

- Timely action will be taken to mitigate any risks to individuals involved.
- Chatterbox Solutions will cooperate fully with official investigations and maintain a survivor-centered approach throughout the process.

## Training and Awareness

- Regular safeguarding training will be mandatory for all staff and contractors.
- Refresher courses and awareness-raising sessions will be conducted at least **annually**.

## Review and Revision

- This Policy will be reviewed at least **annually**, or sooner if required by law or after a serious incident.
- Updates will be clearly communicated to all staff, and training will be revised accordingly.
