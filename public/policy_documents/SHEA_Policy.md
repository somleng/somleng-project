# Sexual Harassment, Exploitation, and Abuse (SHEA) Policy

## 1. Introduction

Chatterbox Solutions is committed to providing a safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment for all employees, partners, clients, and stakeholders. Sexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse (SHEA) are unacceptable behaviors that violate human rights, dignity, and equality. This policy outlines Chatterbox Solutions' zero-tolerance approach to SHEA and establishes procedures for preventing, addressing, and remedying such conduct within the organization.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, clients, partners, and anyone representing Chatterbox Solutions in any capacity, regardless of their position or seniority.

## 3. Definitions

- **Sexual Harassment**: Any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including verbal, non-verbal, or physical behavior, that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment or interferes with an individual's work performance.

- **Exploitation**: Any abuse of power, position, or authority for sexual purposes, including but not limited to, sexual favors, coercion, threats, or manipulation.

- **Abuse**: Any form of sexual violence, coercion, or exploitation, including physical, psychological, or emotional harm inflicted on an individual without their consent.

## 4. Prohibited Conduct

Chatterbox Solutions prohibits all forms of SHEA, including but not limited to:

- Sexual advances, propositions, or requests for sexual favors.
- Unwelcome sexual comments, jokes, gestures, or innuendos.
- Displaying sexually suggestive material in the workplace.
- Coercion, intimidation, or threats related to sexual activity.
- Exploitative relationships or abuse of authority for sexual gain.
- Any form of sexual violence, assault, or misconduct.

## 5. Reporting Procedure

Employees, contractors, volunteers, clients, partners, or any individual who experiences or witnesses SHEA-related behavior within Chatterbox Solutions are encouraged to report such incidents promptly. Reports can be made anonymously to: <a href="mailto:whistleblowers@somleng.org?subject=Reporting of SHEA incident">whistleblowers@somleng.org</a>. Upon reporting a concern, a whistleblower can expect a response acknowledging the receipt of the concern.

Reports may be made verbally or in writing, and confidentiality will be respected to the fullest extent possible. Chatterbox Solutions will take all reports seriously and investigate them promptly and impartially.

## 6. Investigation and Resolution

Upon receiving a report of SHEA-related behavior, Chatterbox Solutions will conduct a thorough and impartial investigation. The investigation will be conducted in a timely manner and with due regard for the privacy and dignity of all parties involved.

If the investigation confirms that SHEA has occurred, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against the perpetrator, up to and including termination of employment or contractual relationship. Chatterbox Solutions will also provide support and assistance to the victim/survivor as needed.

## 7. Non-Retaliation

Chatterbox Solutions prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports SHEA-related behavior or participates in an investigation. Retaliation against individuals who report concerns, seek assistance, or participate in an investigation is a violation of this policy and will result in disciplinary action.

## 8. Awareness and Training
