# Partner Selection Due Diligence Policy

## Introduction

Chatterbox Solutions is committed to conducting thorough due diligence when selecting partners to ensure alignment with the organization's values, goals, standards, and safeguarding responsibilities. This Due Diligence Policy ("Policy") outlines the principles, guidelines, and procedures for assessing and selecting partners, with specific attention to safeguarding children and vulnerable adults.

## Objectives

The objectives of this Due Diligence Policy are to:

- Evaluate potential partners based on criteria such as reputation, capabilities, financial stability, compliance with legal and ethical standards, and safeguarding practices.
- Mitigate risks associated with partnering with external entities, including reputational, financial, operational, legal, and safeguarding risks.
- Ensure transparency, accountability, and consistency in partner selection processes.

## Due Diligence Process

1. **Identification of Potential Partners**
   Potential partners may be identified through referrals, networking, requests for proposals (RFPs), or other means. All potential partners must be assessed against predetermined criteria to determine suitability, including safeguarding alignment.

2. **Preliminary Screening**
   A preliminary screening process shall be conducted to gather basic information about potential partners, including their reputation, track record, capabilities, financial stability, and adherence to safeguarding standards.

3. **Detailed Due Diligence**
   A comprehensive due diligence process shall be conducted for selected potential partners. This may include:

   - **Background Checks**: Verify the legal entity, ownership structure, and registration status of the potential partner.
   - **Financial Analysis**: Assess the financial health and stability of the potential partner, including financial statements, credit reports, and references from financial institutions.
   - **Reputation Assessment**: Evaluate the reputation and credibility of the potential partner through references, customer testimonials, and online reviews.
   - **Compliance Review**: Ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, industry standards, and ethical guidelines, including anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, data protection, and safeguarding regulations.
   - **Safeguarding Assessment**:
     - Review the potential partner's safeguarding policies, procedures, and training materials.
     - Assess whether they have a designated safeguarding focal point or lead.
     - Evaluate their track record in preventing and responding to safeguarding incidents.
     - Confirm that appropriate reporting mechanisms and accountability structures are in place.
   - **Capability Assessment**: Evaluate the technical capabilities, expertise, and resources of the potential partner to meet Chatterbox Solutions' requirements and expectations, including their ability to uphold safeguarding standards in their operations.

4. **Risk Assessment**
   Assess the risks associated with partnering with the potential partner, including reputational, financial, operational, legal, and safeguarding risks. Risk mitigation strategies shall be developed and implemented as necessary. Any safeguarding-related concerns will be treated as a high priority.

5. **Decision Making**
   Based on the findings of the due diligence process and risk assessment, a decision shall be made whether to proceed with the partnership. The decision shall be documented and approved by designated authorities. Partnerships will not proceed where safeguarding risks are unaddressed or unacceptable.

6. **Contractual Agreements**
   Contracts and agreements with selected partners shall clearly outline the rights, responsibilities, obligations, and terms of the partnership, including:

   - Performance metrics and deliverables
   - Payment terms and dispute resolution mechanisms
   - **Safeguarding requirements**, including compliance with Chatterbox Solutions’ Child Protection and Vulnerable Adult Safeguarding Policy, mandatory reporting obligations, and immediate notification of any safeguarding concerns or incidents.

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Partnership Committee**
   The Partnership Committee shall oversee the partner selection process, review due diligence findings (including safeguarding assessments), and make recommendations for partnership approval.

2. **Due Diligence Team**
   A Due Diligence Team comprising representatives from relevant departments—such as legal, finance, operations, compliance, and safeguarding—shall be responsible for conducting due diligence activities and preparing due diligence reports.

3. **Senior Management**
   Senior management shall be responsible for approving partnership decisions and ensuring compliance with this Policy, with final accountability for safeguarding considerations.

## Review and Revision

This Due Diligence Policy shall be reviewed at least annually to ensure its effectiveness, relevance, and compliance with changing business needs, regulatory requirements, and emerging safeguarding standards. Any updates or revisions to the Policy shall be approved by senior management and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
