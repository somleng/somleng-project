## What is Somleng?

Somleng is the world's only Open Source Telco-as-a-service (TaaS) and Cloud-communications-as-a-service (CPaaS).
With the support of UNICEF, we're helping to save lives by reaching some of the most remote and vulnerable communities around the world. [Learn more](https://www.somleng.org).

> Our vision is a world where communications is accessible to everyone.

You can use Somleng to roll out your own programmable voice and SMS to:

* üè• [Save lives](https://www.somleng.org/case_studies.html#early-warning-system-cambodia)
* üßíüèΩ [Improve the lives of children](https://www.somleng.org/case_studies.html#mhealth-unicef-guatemala)

## How does it work?

The diagram below shows how each component is connected together.

![Somleng-Overview](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-project/raw/main/somleng_overview.png)

### Explanation

On the left hand side, applications such as [RapidPro](https://community.rapidpro.io/), [Somleng SCFM](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-scfm), Early Warning Systems, or your own custom application use [Twilio's libraries](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries) to connect to [Somleng's Open Source Implementation of Twilio's REST API](https://www.somleng.org/docs/twilio_api) by updating the endpoint in the helper library from `api.twilio.org` to `api.somleng.org` (or to your own URL running Somleng).

[Somleng](https://github.com/somleng/somleng) then connects to carriers, aggregators, network providers, VoIP gateways, or SMS gateways in order to make or receive calls/SMS from the telephone network via [SomlengSWITCH](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-switch) which interprets the [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml) (provided by the connecting application on the left) in order to control a call / SMS.

More information on the various components are listed below. More detailed information about each component can be found in the individual project repositories.
