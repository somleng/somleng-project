## About this Repository

This repository is the entry point for The Somleng Project. The README links to the individual software components that make up Somleng. The repository also contains the source code for [somleng.org](https://www.somleng.org).

## What is Somleng?

Somleng is the world's only Open Source Telco-as-a-service (TaaS) and Cloud-communications-as-a-service (CPaaS).
With the support of UNICEF, we're helping to save lives by reaching some of the most remote and vulnerable communities around the world. [Learn more](https://www.somleng.org).

> Our vision is a world where communications is accessible to everyone.

You can use Somleng to roll out your own programmable voice and SMS to:

* üè• [Save lives](https://www.somleng.org/case_studies.html#early-warning-system-cambodia)
* üßíüèΩ [Improve the lives of children](https://www.somleng.org/case_studies.html#mhealth-unicef-guatemala)
* ü§ë [For fun or profit](https://www.somleng.org/case_studies.html#powering-cpaas-mexico)

## How does it work?

The diagram below shows how each component is connected together.

![Somleng-Overview](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-project/raw/main/somleng_overview.png)

### Explanation

On the left hand side, applications such as [RapidPro](https://community.rapidpro.io/), [Somleng SCFM](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-scfm), Early Warning Systems, or your own custom application use [Twilio's libraries](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries) to connect to [Somleng's Open Source Implementation of Twilio's REST API](https://www.somleng.org/docs/twilio_api) by updating the endpoint in the helper library from `api.twilio.org` to `api.somleng.org` (or to your own URL running Somleng).

[Somleng](https://github.com/somleng/somleng) then connects to carriers, aggregators, network providers, VoIP gateways, or SMS gateways in order to make or receive calls/SMS from the telephone network via [SomlengSWITCH](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-switch) which interprets the [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml) (provided by the connecting application on the left) in order to control a call / SMS.

More information on the various components are listed below. More detailed information about each component can be found in the individual project repositories.

### Somleng

[Somleng](https://github.com/somleng/somleng) is an Open Source Cloud Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS). This is the core engine of Somleng. Some features include:

* An open source implementation of Twilio's REST API for programmable voice and SMS.
* White-label(able) dashboard.

### SomlengSWITCH

[SomlengSWITCH](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-switch) is the low level switching layer for Somleng. Some features include:

* TTS engines
* Open source TwiML parser

### Somleng Simple Call Flow Manager (SCFM)

[Somleng Simple Call Flow Manager (SCFM)](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-scfm) is an application which can be used to connect and process calls through Somleng (or Twilio). Some features include:

* Contact management
* Callflow management

## Getting Started

We recommend you play around with our hosted version to get a feel for how the product works before trying to run it locally. You can find a link to the sign-up page in our [documentation](https://www.somleng.org/docs.html).

Follow the [GETTING STARTED](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-project/blob/main/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide to get Somleng up and running on your local development machine.

## Deployment

The [infrastructure directory](https://github.com/somleng/somleng-project/tree/main/infrastructure/somleng) contains [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration files in order to deploy Somleng to AWS. This repository only contains core infrastructure. Each individual component's infrastructure is in its own repository. Some of the infrastructure in this repository is a dependency of the other components and is shared using [remote state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/remote).

## Hosting

Chatterbox Solutions offers white-labeled Somleng hosting for Carriers. Currently this service is in private beta. Please [contact us](mailto:contact@somleng.org?subject=Somleng%20Inquiry&body=Hi%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AWe're%20interested%20in%20using%20your%20hosting%20services.) for more info.

## Connect with the community

You can join at the [Discord](https://discord.gg/QdrKCW2kPx) channel for asking questions about the project or talk about Somleng with other peers.

## Roadmap

Our 2022 Roadmap is structured around the following strategic building blocks.

* Create more network reachability.
* Add more communication channels.
* Global customer onboarding.

### Create more network reachability

In order to provide a cheaper alternative to existing CPaaS companies, especially in emerging markets, we need to partner with carriers and individuals who can provide in-country network reachability.

We plan to achieve this by the following approaches:

1. Encourage local carriers to use Somleng.

   Local carriers can offer [much cheaper](https://www.somleng.org/case_studies.html#cash-assistance-programme-somalia) pricing than global aggregators which are used by existing CPaaS providers. By using Somleng to offer white-labeled programmable voice and SMS to their customers, local carriers can generate extra revenue which would otherwise go to global CPaaS providers. Additionally local carriers can publish their routes to be used by global customers in the Somleng network.

2. Empower individuals to become in-country network providers.

   Individuals across the globe can generate income by using their own hardware (GSM modem, SIM Box, etc)to provide network connectivity for Somleng. Individuals register their device with Somleng and Somleng will automatically route calls to devices based on network quality and pricing.

### Add more communication channels

Add programmable SMS to the Somleng stack by developing an open source implementation of [Twilio's Programmable SMS API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-resource#create-a-message-resource). Carriers and network providers can configure SMPP routes for programmable SMS similar to programmable voice.

### Global customer onboarding

Once there are local carriers and network providers providing pubic routes on the Somleng network, we can open up global customer onboarding. Customers can then sign-up and use programmable voice and SMS through these providers without the need for a direct relationship with them.
